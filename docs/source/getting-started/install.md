# Getting Started

## Installing Volto

Volto can be installed in any operating system assuming that this requirements
are met:

- [Node.js LTS (12.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python 3.7.x / 2.7.x](https://python.org/) or
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if using the Plone/Guillotina
  docker images)

Depending on the OS that you are using some of the following might change, they
are assuming a MacOS/Linux machine:

## Install nvm (NodeJS version manager)

1. Open a terminal console and type:
```bash
$ touch ~/.bash_profile
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

2. Close the terminal and open a new one or execute:
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

3. Test it:
```
$ nvm version
```

4. Install a LTS version of NodeJS:
```
$ nvm install 12.16.1
$ nvm use 12.16.1
```

5. Test NodeJS:
```
$ node -v
```

## Yarn (NodeJS package manager)

Install the classic version, not the 2.x one, of the popular node package manager.

1. Open a terminal and type:
```
$ curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

2. Test it, running:
```
$ yarn -v
```

!!! tip Alternative methods
    You can install `yarn` using several approaches too, depending on the
    platform you are on. Take a look at the original `yarn`
    [documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for a list of them.

## Docker for Mac

In order to run the API backend, in a quick an easy and hassle way, it's recommended to start running it in a container.

Here are the detailed instructions:

    https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac

1. Download the .dmg from:

    https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg

2. Install the package as any other Mac software, if required, follow
   instructions from:

    https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

3. Check that docker is installed correctly, open a new terminal and type:

```shell
$ docker ps
```

should not throw an error and show the current running containers.

## Run a Volto ready Plone Docker container

We need Plone meet some requirements in order to fully support Volto.
There's a package `kitconcept.voltodemo` that does all the heavy lifting for you.
You can run an standard Plone docker container with the proper configuration using `kitconcept.voltodemo` right away by issuing:

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm --name=plone -p 8080:8080 -e SITE=Plone -e ADDONS="kitconcept.voltodemo" -e ZCML="kitconcept.voltodemo.cors" plone
```

## Install Volto

Use the `create-volto-app` helper utility.

1. Open a terminal and execute:
```
$ npm -g i @plone/create-volto-app
```

!!! tip Installing it using npx
    Optionally, you can also use `npx` utility to install `create-volto-app`
    without having to install it globally. On the other hand, in order to do it, you
    have to install `npx` globally. The advantage is that you don't have to
    upgrade `create-volto-app` each time you want to use it, because `npx` does
    it for you:

    `npx @plone/create-volto-app myvoltoapp`

2. Create a new Volto app using the recently added command, providing the name
   of the new app (folder) to be created.
```
$ create-volto-app myvoltoapp
```

3. Change directory to the newly created folder `myvoltoapp` (or the one you've
   chosen). Then:
```
$ yarn start
```

This command will build an in-memory bundle and execute Volto in development mode. Open a browser to
take a look at http://localhost:3000

## Build the production bundle

In production environments, you should build an static version of your (Volto) app. The
app should be run in a node process (because of the server side rendering
part), but it also have a client part that is provided and deployed by the server
side rendering process.

1. Compile the app using the command:
```
$ yarn build
```
The resultant build is available in the `build` folder.

2. Run the Volto Nodejs process
```
$ yarn start:prod
```

to run the node process with the production build. You can also run it
manually:
```
$ NODE_ENV=production node build/server.js
```
Your production ready Volto will be available in http://localhost:3000
