# Welcome to the Volto developer documentation!

Volto is a React-based frontend for content management systems (CMS), currently
supporting three backend implementations: Plone, Guillotina and a NodeJS
reference implementation.

Plone is a CMS built on Python born back in 2001, and unmatched experience in
the subject.

Plone has very interesting features that appeal to developers and users alike, such as customizable content types, hierarchical URL object traversing and a sophisticated content workflow powered by a granular permissions model. This allows you to build anything from simple websites to enterprise-grade intranets.

Volto exposes all these features and communicates with Plone via its mature REST API. Volto has the ability of being highly themable and customizable.

Volto also supports other APIs like Guillotina, a Python resource management system, inspired by Plone and using the same basic concepts like traversal, content types and permissions model.

Last but not least, it also supports a Volto Nodejs-based backend reference API implementation that demos how other systems could also use Volto to display and create content through it.

As any CMS, Volto is capable of take care of Server Side Rendering (SSR) in
order to support SEO.
